# mail_merge
This Python script, `main.py`, is a simple invitation letter generator. It reads a list of names from a file, substitutes these names into a template letter, and then saves individual invitation letters for each person. It can be useful for generating personalized invitation letters in bulk.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, make sure you have Python installed on your system. This script is compatible with Python 3.x.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Create the following directory structure in the project directory to organize your input and output files:

    ```
    â”œâ”€â”€ Invitation-Letter-Generator
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Input
    â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Letters
    â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ starting_letter.txt
    â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Names
    â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ invited_names.txt
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Output
    â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ReadyToSend
    ```

3. Place the template invitation letter in `./Input/Letters/starting_letter.txt`. The placeholder `[name]` in the letter will be replaced with the names from `./Input/Names/invited_names.txt`.

4. Add the names of the recipients, one per line, in `./Input/Names/invited_names.txt`.

5. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.

6. Run the script by executing the following command:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

7. The personalized invitation letters will be generated in the `./Output/ReadyToSend` directory with filenames like `letter_for_name.txt`.

## Example

Suppose you have the following input files:

**invited_names.txt:**
```
Alice
Bob
Charlie
```

**starting_letter.txt:**
```
Dear [name],

You are cordially invited to our event on [event_date].

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
```

After running the script, the output will be:

```
./Output/ReadyToSend/letter_for_Alice.txt
./Output/ReadyToSend/letter_for_Bob.txt
./Output/ReadyToSend/letter_for_Charlie.txt
```

## Customization

You can customize the template letter and file paths in the `main.py` script to match your specific requirements.
